## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

[Due to the instructions and the intuitive setup of glitch I found this implementation to be pretty easy.
I did need to consult an outside resource for syntax on how to generate random numbers in js as I haven't used it before.
Figuring out the implementation of guess was pretty simple given the flow chart.
All I needed to do was refamliarize myself with exactly what each variable represented.
 This project was a lot of fun! The last time I made a game with a GUI not console based was in high school]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[Is a lot of web development done on online services like this or is it more compiler focused like the languages that we learn in classes.
how many people typically work on each segement(html, js, css) of a simple web application?
This is more an observation than a questioin but I find it really cool that eveything is autosaved and compiled and any syntax errors are pointed out to you
it'x extremely smooth and intuitive.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[I would allow users to choose the number of buttons and how long they wanted their pattern to be so that they could totally customize it to their preffered level of challenge.
I think a winning and losing sound effect/song would also be a pretty cool inclusion.
Overall more user customizability would be my primary focus.
There would also be the option to just run the base version of the game as is if they didnt want to edit it.
Saving custom settings would be nice as well.
Some of the extra features look cool but I found out about this the night before the deadline and I had lecture and homework to do]
